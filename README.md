# Medicinal Leaf Prediction

This project uses a machine learning model to predict the medicinal plant family from an uploaded image of a leaf. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and a custom layer is used in the model architecture. This app is powered by Streamlit, which provides an interactive interface for users to upload images and receive predictions.

## Features
- Upload an image of a leaf to get a prediction of the medicinal plant family.
- Display the uploaded image and its prediction.
- Show a description and uses of the plant.
- Option to provide feedback on the prediction (Correct or Incorrect).

## Requirements
To run this project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow
- Streamlit
- pandas
- numpy
- pillow

### Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow streamlit pandas numpy pillow
```

## Setting up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Download the Model and Dataset:**
   - Place your model file (`model.h5`) in the directory where the script is located.
   - Place your CSV file (`Plants_Desc.csv`) with plant descriptions and uses in the same directory.

3. **Directory Structure:**
   Your directory should look something like this:

   ```text
   ├── model.h5
   ├── Plants_Desc.csv
   ├── app.py  (your Streamlit app script)
   └── incorrect/ (directory for storing incorrect predictions)
   ```

4. **Run the App:**
   To run the app, use the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Access the App:**
   Once the app is running, you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## How to Use

1. **Upload an Image:**
   - On the app’s interface, upload an image of a leaf (JPG, JPEG, or PNG).
   - The image will be resized, and the model will predict the medicinal plant family.
   - The prediction will be displayed along with the description and uses of the plant.

2. **Provide Feedback:**
   - After the prediction, you will be asked whether the prediction is correct.
   - If the prediction is incorrect, you can select the correct label and the image will be stored in the `incorrect` directory for future training or improvements.

## Feedback

Your feedback helps improve the predictions! If you find any errors, you can correct them by selecting the right label and uploading the image for future use.
